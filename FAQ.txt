Q. I've got this error message:

  "cannot guess real-complex dimension list from backward transform"

A. For the real-complex transform, the complex array is Hermitian and
   (approximately) half the size of the real array.  More precisely the first
   dimension of the complex array is N1/2 + 1, with N1 the first dimension of
   the real array (other dimensions remain the same).  Hence N1 cannot be
   guessed form the dimension list of the complex array.  This can be solved
   in two ways: (1) the first time the FFTW object is used to compute a
   forward (that is real to complex) transform so that it can safely guess all
   the dimensions; (2) setup the dimension list when the FFTW object is
   created, for instance:

       f = fftw_new(dims=[2, 128, 512], real=1)

   for an FTTW operator for real-complex transforms of 2-D 128 by 512 real
   arrays.  Note that in this case, the complex arrays will be 65 by 512
   complex arrays.
